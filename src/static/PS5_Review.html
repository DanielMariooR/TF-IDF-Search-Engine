        <p>These specs, however, bely what the PlayStation 5 truly represents. It’s been almost seven years since Sony released the original PlayStation 4, a platform now known for producing some really great games. But it’s starting to show its age; more recent PlayStation 4 games cause the console, OG and pro alike, to wheeze and moan under the strain. It feels like developers have done all they can to wring every last drop of power out of the old girl before setting her out to pasture.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the PlayStation 5 feels like a more significant upgrade from the PlayStation 4 than the PlayStation 4 did coming from the PlayStation 3, especially for someone like me who never splurged on a PlayStation 4 Pro. My technological illiteracy kept me from getting too excited during lead system architect Mark Cerny’s deep-dive presentation on the PlayStation 5’s innards—I still have no idea what a teraflop is and I refuse to learn—but seeing the graphics of the Demon’s Souls remake and the snappy universe-hopping mechanics of Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart in action quickly opened my mind to its possibilities.</p>
        <p>Sony provided me with a retail PlayStation 5 two weeks ago. I’ve spent those two weeks playing Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Astro’s Playroom, with some Bugsnax and Devil May Cry V on the side since they arrived a little late. I’ve transferred over my PlayStation 4 library and saves, the process for which was super easy but the benefits for which remain hazy from game to game. I’ve messed around as much as I can with its settings, trying to familiarize myself with its copious cascading menus. I’ve also wondered if anyone even has the energy to care about—let alone the means to buy—$500 electronics anymore.</p>
        <p>The standard PlayStation 5 cuts an imposing figure, with a bulbous shell protecting its hefty bulk. (Kotaku staff have joked about being able to use the detachable, plastic plates as riot shields if the contentious U.S. presidential election makes that a necessity.) The disc drive creates an extra protrusion on the right side or bottom of the console depending on its placement, which ruins any chance at the wonderful symmetry of the digital edition. A sturdy, plastic base is included as a way to facilitate both vertical and horizontal orientation (neither side is perfectly flat), and setting up is quick enough if you consult the console’s manual to find the single screw’s secret hiding place.</p>
        <p>While the white plates have a matte finish, the black strip down the middle is glossy, which makes it a magnet for dust and lint. Over the course of the last couple of weeks I’ve had to wipe it down what feels like a dozen times to keep it looking pristine, though that might also be a result of my living in a particularly dusty region of California. The power and eject buttons are small and out of the way, with faint markings indicating which is which. I’ve already confused them several times.</p>
