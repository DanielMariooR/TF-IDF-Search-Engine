        <p>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has become a cult phenomenon in the world of anime. The first three parts have aired on Adult Swim's Toonami block, which is currently broadcasting Part 4. Part 5, still airing in Japan, is drawing crowds on Crunchyroll, and recently won the Best Character Design award at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards. Viz, meanwhile, is publishing the original manga. Part 3's protagonist Jotaro Kujo and antagonist Dio Brando are playable in the Jump Force video game. Robert Rodriguez mentioned at Crunchyroll Expo 2018 that JoJo is the anime he's most interested in adapting into a movie after Battle Angel Alita. JoJo memes are so common online that the question "Is this a JoJo reference?" has become a meme in and of itself.</p>
        <p>There's good reason for the series' popularity. It's extremely entertaining and imaginative; but at the same time, it's also understandable if new viewers are intimidated by it. With over 132 episodes of anime as of this writing and even more manga, it's a significant time investment. Luckily, though, each part has new characters and a different style and tone, allowing a few potential jumping-on points. As for where the best place to start watching the JoJo anime, that will depend on what you're interested in, as each part has its ups and downs, and not everyone enjoys every one. Here, then, is our guide to the five-part anime thus far and what newcomers need to know about each.</p>
        <p>If you want the full JoJo experience, starting at the beginning is the way to go, but be aware of what you're getting into. Phantom Blood, which is Part 1 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, is a quick watch; it is only nine episodes long and it certainly has its charms. Dio Brando is an instant classic villain; he's so ridiculously evil, he kicks a dog in the first episode and only escalates from there. Supporting characters like Robert EO Speedwagon also make an impression and prove important in future parts. The animation is striking, and both the opening theme ("Sono Chi no Sadame") and the ending theme ("Roundabout" by Yes, the first of many English rock ending themes) are equally amazing.</p>
        <p>The thing with Phantom Blood is that, while it certainly has its "bizarre" elements, it's not as wildly creative as later parts. It's a Victorian gothic horror tale that's too campy to be truly scary, but also isn't quite as purposefully funny as the series would later become. Jonathan Joestar makes for a fairly bland protagonist, and while the action is fun and directed with a flair for the dramatic, the style is also atypical of what it would evolve into, using a "Hamon" magic system that's since been abandoned. Part 1 is worth watching, but also the most skippable JoJo content.</p>
