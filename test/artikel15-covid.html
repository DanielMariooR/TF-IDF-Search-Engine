        <p>Exactly how the coronavirus kills is a mystery. But part of the problem may be a partnership between just two immune system chemicals that triggers deadly organ damage.In mice, a combination of immune chemicals called TNF alpha and gamma interferon trips a domino chain of biochemical reactions that ultimately leads to three types of cell death, researchers report October 29 at bioRxiv.org. That wave of cell death further feeds an escalation of immune chemicals, known as a cytokine storm, that leads to more cell death and causes tissue and organ damage and failure.If the same process happens in people with severe COVID-19, the research points to several existing drugs that might help calm the cytokine storm and prevent severe disease or aid recovery. The preliminary results, however, have not yet been reviewed by other scientists.Study after study has found that people with severe COVID-19 have elevated levels of inflammation-stimulating chemicals called cytokines in their blood compared with healthy people, says immunologist Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. But the mechanism by which cytokines can lead to organ failure and death isn’t known.Kanneganti and colleagues selected eight of the most commonly elevated cytokines in severely ill COVID-19 patients to see how the cytokines affect cells growing in lab dishes. Alone, none of cytokines caused harm to infection-fighting macrophage cells. But when the researchers treated macrophages with a cocktail of all eight cytokines, “we were seeing dramatic cell death, unbelievable, through the roof,” Kanneganti says. The team then tried various combinations of cytokines and discovered that only the pairing of TNF alpha and gamma interferon was deadly to macrophages.</p>
