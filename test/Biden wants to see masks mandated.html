        <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif">Biden wants to see masks mandated in all 50 states. These are the ones that don't require them</h1>
        <p>While health officials agree face masks help prevent the spread of Covid-19, state and local governments have varied widely on implementation of mask rules. Now, President-elect Joe Biden wants to change that.Biden's office has released plans that his administration intends to implement in the beginning of his term, and one is a national mask mandate "by working with governors and mayors."Most states already have some type of mask mandate, but some have no statewide rule -- either leaving it as a recommendation or giving the authority to local officials.</p>
        <p>In a speech Monday, Biden implored Americans to stop politicizing masks and social distancing. "Please, I implore you, wear a mask," the President-elect said. "Do it for yourself, do it for your neighbor. A mask is not a political statement but it is a way to start pulling the country together."</p>
        <p>During the campaign, Biden spoke of his plan to issue a nationwide mask mandate. Doing so could be challenged in court, though, and in October Biden said he would go to every governor and urge them to issue mask mandates.</p>
        <p>Because the virus is mainly airborne, face masks are the most effective way to stop person-to-person spread of Covid-19, studies have shown.</p>
        <p>"Wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the Covid-19 pandemic, prior to the development of a vaccine," researchers in Texas and California wrote back in June.</p>
