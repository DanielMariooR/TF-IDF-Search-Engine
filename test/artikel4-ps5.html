        <p>In many ways, the PlayStation 5 feels like a more significant upgrade from the PlayStation 4 than the PlayStation 4 did coming from the PlayStation 3, especially for someone like me who never splurged on a PlayStation 4 Pro. My technological illiteracy kept me from getting too excited during lead system architect Mark Cerny’s deep-dive presentation on the PlayStation 5’s innards—I still have no idea what a teraflop is and I refuse to learn—but seeing the graphics of the Demon’s Souls remake and the snappy universe-hopping mechanics of Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart in action quickly opened my mind to its possibilities.</p>
