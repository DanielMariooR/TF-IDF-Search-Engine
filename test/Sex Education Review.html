        <p>Sex Education explores the uncomfortable side of sex, rather than portraying it as a ritual passing into adulthood like so many other teen shows and movies do. It also delves into the fears, anxieties and embarrassment concerning sexual exploration.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, it does so in a way that normalizes these topics, rather than makes them seem strange or fetishized. When a character realizes they are pansexual, this is accepted. Similarly, when a tearful character confesses she has zero interest in sex, she is informed about asexuality and has it confirmed that she is indeed normal. A wide array of people who lack representation in the media can watch the show, find a connection to a character and hear a voice that affirms and accepts their identity.</p>
        <p>When one looks at the over-sexed, glamorized depictions of high schools in the media, it can be hard to find an accurate representation of what it's like to be a teenager. Sex Education normalizes things that should be normal, but these subjects are stilled considered taboo by society. It covers topics such as a virgin wanting to stay celibate in a positive way, as well as showing that not all men are driven by sex, let alone want it.</p>
        <p>The takeaway of Sex Education is to accept both yourself and your sexuality. The show both educates audiences on topics that are sadly seldom discussed and encourages self-acceptance. Along the way, it depicts honest accounts of sex and relationships and offers raw and unflinching advice about the complicated, confusing and exciting journey of sexual discovery.</p>
