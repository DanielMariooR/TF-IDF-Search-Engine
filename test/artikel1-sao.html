        <p>Originally self-published online under a pseudonym, Reki Kawahara's Sword Art Online began its novel journey in 2009 and now spans 24 mainline novels and a multitude of spin-offs. In 2012, when Alicization was in full swing and the anime's first season was coming to a close, Kawahara released the first Sword Art Online: Progressive novel.Some clickbait-y headlines will tell you it's a "reboot" of Sword Art Online, but "retelling" would be a more appropriate term since the franchise doesn't exactly need reviving. Think of it like Rogue One: A Star Wars Story: it retroactively expands the universe by filling a lore gap with new characters and untold events. For Progressive, that gap is the series of timeskips between the Town of Beginnings and the final battle on Aincrad's 75th floor. After all, we only got to see a tiny fraction of Akihiko Kayaba's hundred-layer dream world. You could theoretically watch Progressive without the original series, depending on how forgiving the adaptation is, but it's not recommended.</p>
