        <p>In term of story structure, Jojo isâ€¦ Okay.As is well known, Jojo consists of several parts (now there are 8 parts) and in fact all of them cannot be generalized, which means that each part has its own uniqueness.Each part of Jojo has a different main character, which in my opinion is a unique idea that keeps the story fresh.Jojo's main strength is style, action, and cleverness in it. These three things were so highlighted in the jojo series that some became memes.</p>
