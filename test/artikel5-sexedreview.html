        <p>My first impression about Sex Education is, this show is a school drama revolving around the topic "Sex". Not that this will be an educational event, but it will raise the topic of sex so as to create a unique drama. In addition, the main character is played by Asa Butterfly (i know it's butterfield, shut up). So, I'm more interested. And now, I'm done seeing it. What do i think? First, this series has quite a lot of sex scenes, although it's not overt. The sex and nudity scenes in episode 1 of season 1 are a bit exaggerated, but the frequency decreases throughout the season. Second, my guess was wrong. This is not a school drama that revolves around the topic of sex, but a school drama with sex in it. Maybe you don't agree, but let me explain.</p>
