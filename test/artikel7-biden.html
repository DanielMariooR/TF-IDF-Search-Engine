        <p>hile health officials agree face masks help prevent the spread of Covid-19, state and local governments have varied widely on implementation of mask rules. Now, President-elect Joe Biden wants to change that.Biden's office has released plans that his administration intends to implement in the beginning of his term, and one is a national mask mandate "by working with governors and mayors."Most states already have some type of mask mandate, but some have no statewide rule -- either leaving it as a recommendation or giving the authority to local officials.</p>
